    <h4>This is my academic background :</h4>
    <p>
        I studied at Rosemont College to have a DEC in ¬´Network Management¬ª at the end of my studies, which is located in the Montreal area. It is an institution in    post-secondary education. My study period spans from the winter of 2003 to the end of spring 2006.
        In the summer of 2006, as part of my DEC, I did my internship at La Ronde amusement park, a property of Six Flags.
    </p>

    <h4>Tasks related to my internship :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Answer to employee calls from La Ronde to solve their Level 1 computer problems.
        </li>
        <li>Installation / Repair of computer systems (Windows).</li>
        <li>Inventory the computer park.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Almost immediately after my internship, I was fortunate enough to work for a telecom company ¬´Videotron¬ª which was growing at the time thanks to its revolutionary ¬´cable telephony¬ª product which I became even makes a ¬´telephony planning analyst¬ª. By the
        way, I'm still employed by this company since September 2006.
    </p>

    <h4>Tasks related to my work at Videotron :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wired telephony orders processing in Remedy.</li>
        <li>Cellular order processing (since 2013).</li>
        <li>Call processing of different departments.</li>
        <li>Routers static IP configuration for enterprise.</li>
        <li>Address management throughout Videotron.</li>
        <li>Complex report management via Excel / Word.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am a person who always wants to learn new things in my work and in everyday life.</p>

    <h4>And suddenly ! A click, it's done in my head!</h4>

    <p>
        In life, there are many people who will mark us for good and bad reasons. At the beginning of winter 2013, my former colleague Xavier is in the ¬´good reason¬ª category. Thanks to his knowledge of PHP and SQL programming languages, he helped me to improve
        my way of working thanks to data extraction programs in the different databases of my sector of activity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Unfortunately, he left us to take on other professional challenges. So I had to fend for myself, to understand its tools with at the time rudimentary knowledge of programming languages of all kinds.
    </p>

    <p>Quickly, I began to understand very briefly the PHP and the famous trio "Select / From / Where" three super powerful words to make SQL queries.</p>
    <h4>In June 2015, the return to school was not very far...</h4>

    <p>
        So I started a period of reflection doing research on what kind of part-time study that I could start. I came to the conclusion that I had to start a certificate in ¬´network and telecommunication¬ª at University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM). At the time,
        the choice was obvious as I was in this area. I started it in the fall of 2015.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At the beginning of the certificate, I had to do several courses of programming before doing the more specialized courses in telecommunications. The more I advanced, the more I realized that, finally, I had some form of logic for programming. During the
        winter 2017 session, I decided to change the certificate for the fall of 2017. I am currently going to do ¬´Computer Science and Software Development¬ª.

    <h4>Except that during the fall of 2022, I finally decided to transfer all to the real IT BACC...</h4>
    <p>
        I started the process to enroll in the ¬´ Bachelor's degree in computer science and software engineering ¬ª. Once accepted, I had to do
        recognize my previously completed courses as much as possible.<br>I managed to have my first certificate recognized without too much
        difficulty. Once my fall 2022 course is completed and my certificate completed at the same time, I will be able to do
        recognize all my second certificate courses.<br>Finally, I will have 12 courses left to complete my course
        university.
